# Attendance

This project is about the school teacher that wants to take record of class attendance daily. The teacher is an english teacher with six english classes. The teacher wants to add the students to her classes at will. The teacher must reflect on daily attendance on classes. The teacher can alternatively reflect on quarterly class attendance. The system on that respect respect treats school teachers as administrators. Scholars or students are customers. Of course, the teacher is an Employee to the school, with employee number,salary, address,contact details. That of course is not handled because of time on this simulation. But as part of the long term solution is fundamental.

The technical approach, is to ensure teachers register to the system their personal credentials which are not relevant to their proffession as teachers, but are crucial to their employer as employees. The student is required to register all their private credentials to the school including Id numbers, place of birth, as this information is required for rica purposes for national demographics. 

The project has not covered all the aspects of the problem as it just as demo. For this project I have looked into these components from the backend:
User Registration (Teacher)
Authentication(Teacher)
Class Attendance(Grade)
Associating a student to a grade
Reporting on Attendance Monthly
Reporting on Attendance Daily
